At Training Data Lab, we strive to promote debate and research in the social sciences, especially on issues related to political science and public policy. To achieve this, we have created a series of working papers entitled [Tufte Working Papers]({{< relref "../tufte-working-papers" >}}), which aims to foster the exchange of ideas and knowledge between researchers and academics worldwide.

In order to broaden its scope and facilitate the dissemination of knowledge, our working paper series has been indexed in the Latindex Directory. This news is a great achievement for our research group, as Latindex is an international reference database that collects information on scientific and academic publications in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.

 **What is Latindex?**

Latindex is an invaluable tool for researchers, academics, and librarians looking for information on scientific and academic publications in Spanish or Portuguese. It was created in 1995 by the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Spain) to promote the dissemination of knowledge produced in these regions.

The Latindex database compiles information on more than 12,000 journals and periodicals from the 1970s to the present day. Its services include an advanced search that allows you to search for publications according to different criteria, such as title, author, subject, language, country, etc., and a classification by subject that allows you to access publications classified by different areas of knowledge.

**Tufte Working Papers: A series of innovative papers**

Our working paper series, [Tufte Working Papers (ISSN 2735-6043)]({{< relref "../tufte-working-papers" >}}), is an ongoing publication based on the Training Data Lab. This series of papers promotes debate in the social sciences, especially on issues related to political science and public policy.

Our series editors are our research associates, [Basti치n Gonz치lez-Bustamante]({{< relref "../authors/bgonzalezbustamante" >}}) and [Basti치n Gonz치lez-Bustamante]({{< relref "../authors/jmorillo" >}}), who strive to select innovative, relevant, and high-quality papers. The series includes unpublished papers and revised versions of previous publications that propose innovative research techniques or offer novel empirical information.

**Objectives and features**

Our series has several important objectives. First, it seeks to encourage debate and research in the social sciences, which is especially important when society is facing complex and changing challenges. Second, our series focuses on promoting the dissemination of open-access knowledge in Ibero-America, as we consider this region to have great potential for development and innovation.

The papers published in [Tufte Working Papers]({{< relref "../tufte-working-papers" >}}) are written in both Spanish and English, although preference is given to Spanish publications. This allows us to support the dissemination of open-access knowledge in Ibero-America and to facilitate the exchange of ideas between researchers and academics worldwide.

**Indexing in Latindex: A great achievement**.

Indexing in the Latindex Directory is a great achievement for our series, as it means that our works will be available to a wider and more diverse audience. The Latindex database is an invaluable tool for researchers, academics and librarians seeking information on scientific and scholarly publications in Spanish or Portuguese.

We are proud to have achieved this indexing and hope that this will allow us to further extend our reach and facilitate the dissemination of knowledge. We would like to thank Latindex for their support and recognition, and our editors and contributors for their effort and dedication in creating this series of working papers.
