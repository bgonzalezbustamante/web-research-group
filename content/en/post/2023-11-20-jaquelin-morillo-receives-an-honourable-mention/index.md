On 16 and 17 November 2023, the Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte in Antofagasta hosted the IX Annual Congress of the Chilean Scientific Society of Psychology (SCP), a meeting that brought together leading researchers and scientists to share their findings and discuss the latest advances in the field of psychology. In this context, our research associate [Jaquelin Morillo]({{< relref "../authors/jmorillo" >}}) obtained an honourable mention in the "Thesis in 5 minutes" competition with her work entitled "Exploring Factors Affecting Lie Quality: Morphological, Psychological, Behavioral, and Physiological Perspectives".

[Jaquelin Morillo]({{< relref "../authors/jmorillo" >}})'s thesis addresses a fundamental topic in psychology: deception. Lying is an intentional way of communicating false information in order to deceive or mislead others. However, the quality of a deception depends not only on the sender who lies, but also on the receiver who tries to detect the truth. Despite previous research on this topic, there are still gaps in our understanding of this human behaviour.

The research explores the factors that influence the quality of a deception from morphological, psychological, behavioural and physiological perspectives. To achieve this, an experimental approach was designed to assess variables such as physical attractiveness, Dark Triad personality (charisma, emotional manipulation and lack of empathy), circulating cortisol levels, body language and facial microexpressions. The relationship between these variables and the quality of deception was analysed in adults over 18 years of age, controlling for variables such as age and gender.

Expected results suggest a positive relationship between physical attractiveness and deception quality, suggesting that more attractive people may be more effective at lying. Positive relationships are also anticipated between Dark Triad traits and deception quality, mediated by non-verbal cues and cortisol levels. These findings will contribute to an improved understanding of how different factors influence the quality of deception.

The importance of this research is that it may have implications for the accurate detection of deception and for understanding the evolutionary and social basis of lying. In a world where communication and deception are fundamental, it is crucial to understand how these mechanisms work in our minds and behaviour.

[Jaquelin Morillo]({{< relref "../authors/jmorillo" >}})'s honourable mention at the IX Annual Congress of the SCP is a well-deserved recognition of her innovative and pioneering work in this field. Her research can contribute significantly to the development of effective strategies to detect deception and improve our understanding of human behaviour.
