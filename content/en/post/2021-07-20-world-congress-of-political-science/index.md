Between 10 and 15 July 2021, our Training Data Lab research team had the honour of presenting research at the World Congress of Political Science, organised by the International Political Science Association (IPSA). Although the COVID-19 pandemic forced the event to be held virtually for the first time in IPSA's history, it did not prevent our research associates [Carla Cisternas]({{< relref "../authors/ccisternas" >}}) and [Basti치n Gonz치lez-Bustamante]({{< relref "../authors/bgonzalezbustamante" >}}) from sharing their findings with the international community.

The presentation entitled "Political Careers and Cosponsorship in the Chilean Lower House 2006-2018" focused on analysing the impact of endogenous and exogenous effects on the dynamic structure of legislative cosponsorship in Chile between 2006 and 2018. During this period, three legislative sessions took place under the governments of Michelle Bachelet (2006-2010), Sebasti치n Pi침era (2010-2014) and Bachelet's second term (2014-2018).

In order to assess changes in cosponsorship relations from one year to the next in the Chamber of Deputies, our research associates employed Stochastic Actor-Oriented (SAO) models. At the same time, they analysed dyadic and individual covariates such as political party affiliation, official or opposition positions in relation to the government, constituency overlap and geographical contiguity. They also assessed chamber tenure and sponsorship activity.

The main findings suggest a segregation in collaboration based on political parties, coalitions and geographical location. In addition, it was found that the greater an MP's experience and sponsorship activity, the more likely he or she was to avoid new collaborations in the short term.

Our research associates' presentation was part of a session discussing the relationship between political careers and legislative cosponsorship in different contexts. The session allowed for a rich and productive exchange with other specialists in the field, allowing us to move forward with our research and improve our models to better understand how political systems work.

At Training Data Lab, we strive to generate knowledge of high quality and relevance in the scientific community. The presentation of our research associates at the World Congress of Political Science is a further example of our commitment to research and international exchange. We are proud to have been able to contribute to this important event and look forward to continue sharing our findings with the scientific community in the near future.
