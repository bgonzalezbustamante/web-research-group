In recent months, our research associate, [Bastián González-Bustamante]({{< relref "../authors/bgonzalezbustamante" >}}), had the honour of presenting his work at three major international conferences in the field of political science. These presentations gave Bastián the opportunity to share his findings with experts and colleagues from around the world and receive valuable feedback.

The first presentation took place at the annual conference of the Society for Latin American Studies (SLAS) in Belfast, UK, on 30-31 March. SLAS is an organisation that focuses on studying Latin America from different disciplines. At this conference, Bastián presented his work on the impact of crises on presidential politics in 12 presidential democracies between the 1970s and today.

In this paper, Bastián analyses how public pressure affects presidential politics, especially in terms of ministerial protection and dismissal. He used data mining and machine learning algorithms to construct unpublished indicators based on press archives. He also used a semi-parametric approach of competing risks and propensity score matching.

The second presentation took place at the 73rd annual international conference of the UK Political Studies Association (PSA) held in Liverpool on 3-5 April. The PSA is a leading organisation in the field of British political science, bringing together experts and practitioners to discuss the latest trends and findings in disciplinary research.

At this conference, Bastián presented his work with an emphasis on the evaluation of the ministerial dismissal rule and how it affects the risk of ministerial resignation. He used moderation analysis to test the reliability of the ministerial dismissal rule in different crisis scenarios.

The third presentation took place at the Joint Sessions of Workshops of the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) organised in Toulouse, France, on 25-28 April. ECPR is an international organisation that focuses on political research at the European level.

At this conference, Bastián presented his work with an emphasis on the importance of analysing crises as key indicators for understanding presidential politics. He also discussed how the risk of ministerial resignation increases significantly in the face of repeated public pressure and how this is moderated in different scenarios.

In summary, [Bastián González-Bustamante]({{< relref "../authors/bgonzalezbustamante" >}})'s presentations at these three international conferences demonstrated his ability to analyse complex policy and statistical problems and present innovative findings to a specialised audience. These efforts contribute to the mission of our research group, the Training Data Lab, which focuses on developing innovative methods to analyse large datasets and improve our understanding of the world.
