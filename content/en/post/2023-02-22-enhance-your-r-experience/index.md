**What makes the Vibrant Ink Flavoured Theme special?**

[Vibrant Ink Flavoured Theme](https://github.com/bgonzalezbustamante/v-ink-flavoured) is an enhanced version of the popular Vibrant Ink theme for RStudio. Adding a touch of style to your code editor, this new theme aims to make your coding experience more fun and efficient. With its unique colour palette and layout design, you'll be able to focus on writing beautiful code while staying organised and productive.

**How do I get started with Vibrant Ink Flavoured Theme?**

To set up [Vibrant Ink Flavoured Theme](https://github.com/bgonzalezbustamante/v-ink-flavoured) in RStudio, simply follow these steps:

1. Open your RStudio IDE.
2. Navigate to Tools > Global Options > Appearance.
3. Click on the "Theme" tab.
4. Select "Import" and choose the tmTheme file from the [Vibrant Ink Flavoured Theme](https://github.com/bgonzalezbustamante/v-ink-flavoured) package.

**Why R is a powerful tool for social research?**

R is an incredibly versatile programming language that has revolutionised the way researchers work in various fields, including the social sciences. Its popularity is due to its ease of use, flexibility and extensive library of packages and resources. With R, you can:

* Analyse and visualise large datasets with ease.
* Perform complex statistical analysis using popular libraries such as caret and dplyr.
* Create interactive visualisations with Shiny or plotly.
* Automate data processing tasks with workflows and pipelines.

In social research, R has become an essential tool for:

* Data analysis and visualisation: Researchers can use R to analyse and visualise large data sets, allowing them to identify trends, patterns and correlations.
* Statistical modelling: R's extensive statistical library allows researchers to perform complex analyses, such as regression, generalised linear models and temporal forecasting. 
* Reproducibility: R's focus on replication makes it an ideal tool for social research, where replicability is crucial.

**Complementing Vibrant Ink Flavoured Theme with Modern theme**

While [Vibrant Ink Flavoured Theme](https://github.com/bgonzalezbustamante/v-ink-flavoured) is designed to be used as a standalone theme, we recommend complementing it with RStudio's Modern theme. The Modern theme theme provides a clean, minimalist design that blends well with Vibrant Ink's vibrant colour palette.

By combining these two themes, you get the best of both worlds: the unique style of the [Vibrant Ink Flavoured Theme](https://github.com/bgonzalezbustamante/v-ink-flavoured) and the simple design of the Modern theme. This combination will allow you to focus on your coding tasks while enjoying an attractive visual environment.
