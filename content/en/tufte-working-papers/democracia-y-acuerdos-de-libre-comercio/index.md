abstract: 'This work evaluates the pertinence of considering democratic development based on the depth reached by trade agreements. This idea, which is reviewed from the update of analytical categories supported by the theory of democratic peace, shows that, although the results would confirm this type of argument, they tend to reveal as an explanatory factor on the level of depth reached by a trade agreement, as the presence chapters that liberalise regulatory frameworks and, in particular, contextual factors such as the 1990s and 2000s. Updated information on 692 free trade agreements  signed between 1948 and 2021 was used, along with linear regressions with adjustments for intervening effects and multilevel structures.'

This work evaluates the pertinence of considering democratic development based on the depth reached by trade agreements. This idea, which is reviewed from the update of analytical categories supported by the theory of democratic peace, shows that, although the results would confirm this type of argument, they tend to reveal as an explanatory factor on the level of depth reached by a trade agreement, as the presence chapters that liberalise regulatory frameworks and, in particular, contextual factors such as the 1990s and 2000s. Updated information on 692 free trade agreements  signed between 1948 and 2021 was used, along with linear regressions with adjustments for intervening effects and multilevel structures.
