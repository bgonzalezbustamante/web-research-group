This is a Twitter online tracker of the Chilean referendum for a New Constitution in October 2020, which contains merged, daily data sets on #Apruebo and #Rechazo viewpoints on this social media.

<!--more-->

The newest data sets were collected in February 2023 in JSON format. The original data sets in CSV UTF-8 were scraped and uploaded regularly. Some of the variables are date, hour, username, tweet text, RT count, fav count, location, among others. The data were collected during the afternoon each day. A couple of exceptions, such as October 6th and 26th, 2020, were collected early morning on the following day. This is not an issue because the data could be sliced, and in order to work with the whole period, it is necessary to merge the sets and retain unique cases in the case of the original sets.
