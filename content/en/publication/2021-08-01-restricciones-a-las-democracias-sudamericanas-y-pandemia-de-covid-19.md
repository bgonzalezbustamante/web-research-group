abstract: 'In this article, we studied how much of the restriction measures taken in the framework  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  in  South  America,  between  March  2020 and April 2021, respond to the state of the democracies in the Region. The  main  argument  is  that  this  last  variable,  specifically  its  deterioration,  is  more important  than  others  related  to  the  dynamics  of  the  pandemic,  such  as the increase in daily cases and deaths per million inhabitants. Although this hypothesis is  partially  verified,  the  effect  is  particularly  sensitive  to  different  national  realities  and  cases,  specifically  Argentina,  Colombia,  Perú  y  Chile. Models with non-linearity adjustments and differentiated intercepts were used in the estimation.'
