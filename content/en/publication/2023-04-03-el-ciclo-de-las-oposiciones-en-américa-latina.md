abstract: 'With the 2022 elections of Gustavo Petro in Colombia and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil, the analysis of the return of the pink tide to Latin America has suddenly spread. This paper argues that, actually, the region presents a cycle of oppositions, with gover-nments of different colors alternating since the end of the left turn in the 2010s. To substantiate this point, the article presents data on the alternations and the difficulties of the presidents in maintaining an approval rate higher than the disapproval rate from the beginning of their term. The analysis shows that nega-tive perceptions about the country’s current economic situation and the ability to combat the Covid-19 pandemic are the factors that  weigh  the  most  in  the  government’s  assessment.  Political  polarization and exposure to social networks also take their toll, since  there  is  evidence  that  ideological  alignment  conditions  opinion  and  that  users  of  social  networks  are  more  critical  of  the  government. Everything  described  suggests  that,  whatever  the ideological color of who is in power, there will be difficulties in maintaining themselves as such.'
