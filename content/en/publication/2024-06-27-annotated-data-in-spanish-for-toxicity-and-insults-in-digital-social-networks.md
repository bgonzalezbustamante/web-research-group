abstract: 'This repository contains data sets and materials for a gold standard elaboration on toxicity and incivility in the digital sphere based on human coding to benchmark algorithmic classification tasks with transformers and LLMs. The labelling progress is 62%. We are labelling two samples of novel datasets of political digital interactions on Twitter (rebranded as X). The first set comprises almost 5 million data points from three Latin American protest events: (a) protests against the coronavirus and judicial reform measures in Argentina during August 2020; (b) protests against education budget cuts in Brazil in May 2019; and (c) the social outburst in Chile stemming from protests against the underground fare hike in October 2019. We are focusing on interactions in Spanish to elaborate a gold standard for digital interactions in this language, therefore, we prioritise Argentinian and Chilean data. The second set contains more than 31 million messages and more than 9 million interactions between 2010 and 2022, covering the election of members of the first Constitutional Convention in Chile, the drafting process and the referendum in which the proposal was rejected.'
