abstract: 'This paper discusses the entry into force of trade agreements bet-ween Latin American countries and the United States. The objective is to study paths towards the implementation of a free trade agreement with the world’s greatest power in the period 1990-2015, considering three groups of variables: market reforms, geopolitics of trade agreements and commercial links with the world. The results suggest that market reforms have the greatest explanatory impact  on  the  principal  outcome  of  this  study.  The  research  technique  used  was  Event  History  Analysis,  implemented  through  Cox  regression,  in  order  to identify determinants that explain the process. Although this approach has been  widely  used  in  the  field  of  international  relations,  mainly  in  the  study  of conflicts or crises, it is novel in the analysis of the entry into force of trade agreements.'
