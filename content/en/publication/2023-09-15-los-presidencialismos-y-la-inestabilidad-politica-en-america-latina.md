abstract: 'Presidential systems in Latin America have historically been characterized by instability. This article analyzes the challenges faced in establishing presidential systems during the 19th century, a pivotal period which saw the emergence of political regimes. The study delves into the process of state organization during a time when dissenting groups challenged the prevailing trend of concentrating power within institutions, thus putting the design of these institutions to the test. The object is to determine to what extent the beginning of the political system influences a country’s stability. The origins of institutions are crucial not only for understanding presidential systems but also for comprehending why the continent has displayed tolerance toward mechanisms of power concentration. Through a comparative historical analysis of four countries at varying levels of development -Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Uruguay- the study concludes that the stability of presidential designs depended on the governments’ ability to activate mechanisms for containing and incorporating opponents of the new institutional order. Nonetheless, there remains much to explore in understanding political instability in Latin America.'
