abstract: 'In this article, the impact of the democracy of the concurrent par-ties in a free trade agreement was evaluated with the depth of the commitments acquired within the framework of the respective treaties. This argument was reviewed through the evaluation of variables  that  accounted  for  arguments  based  on  liberal  tradi-tions of international relations, specifically democracy, applied to the links reached in free trade agreements. Although the results would  confirm  these  perspective  arguments,  the  greater  rele-vance  to  account  for  a  greater  deepening  of  commercial  links  corresponds  to  contextual  factors,  such  as  the  1990s  and  2000s.  In carrying out this research, updated information on 692 free trade  agreements  signed  between  1948  and  2020,  using  linear  regressions with multilevel structure adjustment.'
