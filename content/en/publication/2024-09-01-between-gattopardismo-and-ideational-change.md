abstract: 'This chapter examines the effects that the socio-economic, cultural and political changes that have occurred in Chile during the last thirty years have produced on the mainstream right in Chile. We argue that these joint processes of liberalization and democratization gave rise to a gattopardista strategy characterized by the programmatic moderation of coalition candidates until the 2017 campaign. Gattopardismo can be defined as a framework of political, legislative or legal behavior that seeks to maintain the status quo by modifying only superficial aspects of reality while creating expectations for more holistic change. Indeed, the traditional right-wing parties moved towards the center to the extent that they did not threaten the pillars of the neoliberal model. However, when centrist and left-wing parties aimed to significantly reform the institutional core, the traditional right did react, and moved further to the right on the ideological continuum. We also look at the consequences that the 2019 social unrest had on the political system, especially on the parties of the then-ruling center-right coalition, Chile Vamos. While a sense of catastrophe set in after the 2020 plebiscite on a new constitution, it took a turn for the worse after the crushing results in the election to nominate the constituents who would draft the proposal.'
