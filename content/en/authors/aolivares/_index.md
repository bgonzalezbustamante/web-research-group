I am a Doctor of Social Sciences and hold an MA in Political Science, both from the [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/). I also earned a BA in Political Science from the [Universidad Central de Chile](https://www.ucentral.cl/).

In addition, I am a researcher at the Fondecyt de Iniciación 11200345, a Chilean National Agency for Research and Development funded project focused on the continuity of public policies in Chile. I recently joined the Núcleo Milenio de Desigualdades y Oportunidades Digitales (NUDOS) as an early career researcher and also am an adjunct researcher at the [Centre for Health and Society Research](https://ciss.umayor.cl/) at the Universidad Mayor, Chile.

Since 2022, I have been the [director of the Public Administration programme at the Universidad Mayor](https://www.umayor.cl/um/carreras/administracion-publica-santiago/10000). Previously, I was a visiting professor at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences ([Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, FLACSO](https://www.flacso.edu.ec/en/inicio)) in Ecuador, a scholar at the Universidad Católica de Temuco, Chile, and a lecturer at the Universidad de Chile.
