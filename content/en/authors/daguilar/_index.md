I am a public servant working on indigenous affairs in the Canadian federal government. I am currently based in the province of Ontario, Canada. Furthermore, I am a Network Leader at the [Brantford Immigration Partnership](https://www.brantford.ca/en/things-to-do/brantford-immigration-partnership.aspx). Before relocating to Canada, I served as a Lawyer and International Relations Coordinator at the Servicio Nacional del Consumidor (SERNAC) in Chile.

I hold an MA in Political Science from the [Institute of Public Affairs](https://inap.uchile.cl/) at the Universidad de Chile and an MA in Global Politics from [McMaster University, Canada](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/). Moreover, I earned an LLB from [Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Chile](https://derecho.uahurtado.cl/). I am interested in transparency and open government, public policies, indigenous affairs and international relations.
