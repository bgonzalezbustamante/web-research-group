I am a Social Policy Officer at Indigenous Services Canada (Federal Government), where I ensure the efficient delivery of sustainable infrastructure projects in First Nation communities. I also serve on the [Board of the Brantford Public Library](https://www.brantfordlibrary.ca/en/about-the-library/library-board.aspx), contributing to policy development and financial oversight.

Before relocating to Canada, I worked as a Lawyer on the collective mediation team and as an International Relations Coordinator at the Servicio Nacional del Consumidor (SERNAC) in Chile.

I hold an MA in Political Science from the [Universidad de Chile](https://gobierno.uchile.cl/), an MA in Global Politics from [McMaster University, Canada](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/), and an LLB from [Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Chile](https://derecho.uahurtado.cl/). My interests include transparency and open government, public policy, Indigenous affairs, and international relations.
