I am a PhD student in [Social Complexity Sciences at the Universidad del Desarrollo](https://dccs.udd.cl/en/), Chile. My interests in political science and human behaviour have led me to follow an academic path focused on quantitative and experimental methodologies.

My academic background is in international studies at the [Universidad Torcuato Di Tella](https://www.utdt.edu/), Argentina. In addition, I hold a masterâ€™s degree in [International Strategy and Trade Policy at the Universidad de Chile](https://iei.uchile.cl/).

My research interests focus on quantitative approaches applied to electoral behaviour, democracy, congressional members and dynamics of human behaviour in socio-political contexts and trade policy.
