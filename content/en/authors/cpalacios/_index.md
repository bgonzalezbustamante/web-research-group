I hold a professional degree in Public Administration, a BA in Government, and an MA in Political Science, all from the Universidad de Chile. My academic research interests have focused on expert knowledge in public policy and governmental elites. Moreover, I have lectured political science courses at the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH), and I am currently a lecturer of political theory at the [Faculty of Government at the Universidad de Chile](https://gobierno.uchile.cl/).

In my years of professional experience in both the public and private sectors, I have worked in multidisciplinary teams and supported decision-making through developing specialised content on public policies. Today, I am a coordinator of studies in a public affairs consultancy. I monitor and analyse the constituent process in Chile and the media agenda, as well as provide advice on various issues relevant to clients.
