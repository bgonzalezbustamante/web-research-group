I am studying for an MA in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the [Universidad del Rosario, Colombia](https://urosario.edu.co/), and I hold a BA in Political Science with a minor in Development and Participation from the same university.

I have three years of experience in quantitative and qualitative research in social sciences. My expertise focuses on programming and the advanced use of software. I am interested in working in interdisciplinary and diverse teams, and my research interests mainly focus on elections, data analysis for social sciences, democracy, post-conflict and peace.
