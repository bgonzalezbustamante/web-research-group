I am a lawyer and earned an LLB (1st) from the [Universidad de Chile](https://derecho.uchile.cl/). I also hold a [Master of Public Policy (MPP) from the University of Oxford, United Kingdom](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). I was awarded the [Luksic Scholars Foundation Scholarship](https://luksicscholars.org/en/) to pursue my MPP at Oxford. In addition, I earned a diploma in administrative law from the Pontificia Universidad Católica in Chile and in economic regulation from the Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Chile.

In my professional career, I have worked in the private sector as a lawyer, focusing on competition and economic regulation across sectors such as transportation, telecommunications, and energy. In the public sector, I served as a Senior Cabinet Advisor and Acting Chief of Staff for the Minister of Labour and Social Security in Chile between 2018 and 2021. Internationally, I represented Chile in the [ILO](https://www.ilo.org/) and G20, worked as a consultant in Spain for the [Ibero-American Social Security Organization](https://oiss.org/), and in the [pensions sector in the United Kingdom](https://the-spp.co.uk/). I am currently involved in the regulatory practice at a [leading law firm in Chile](https://agycia.cl/), specialising in energy markets and economic regulation. Additionally, I serve as a consultant for international institutions, advising on social security markets and pension systems. 

Academically, I have served as a teaching assistant in public and private law at the Universidad de Chile and have recently published articles on pension reforms and the development of energy markets. I also contribute columns and opinion pieces on economic regulation to Chilean media on a regular basis.
